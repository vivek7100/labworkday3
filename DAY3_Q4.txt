//the method of calculating the interest amount for a particular principal amount of money at some rate of interest//




#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float principal, rate, time, interest;

    printf("Enter the principal amount: ");
    scanf("%f", &principal);

    printf("Enter the rate of interest: ");
    scanf("%f", &rate);

    printf("Enter the time period in years: ");
    scanf("%f", &time);

    interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;
    printf("The simple interest is: %.2f\n", interest);

    return 0;
}




Enter the principal amount: 100000
Enter the rate of interest: 2
Enter the time period in years: 5
The simple interest is: 10000.00
